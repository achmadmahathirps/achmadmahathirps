Hello there! 🙋‍♂️

I'm Mahathir, someone who is interested in programming and still learning about it. I'm a final-year undergraduate student pursuing in Computer Science/Informatics Technology and currently interested mainly in 3 fields (still figuring out which field I like the most), which is:
1. Cross-platform UI/UX development (Flutter)
2. Computer vision development (Mediapipe)
3. Unity stuffs

And also other stuffs that are worth learning!
